# PiVoT

### Pivot is an interactive phrasal verb trainer for English as a Second Language Students

Phrasal Verbs are a particularly difficult aspect of English for people learning the language.
Unfortunately, the only way to improve your use of them is through a lot of repetition which is
usually a very boring process for most students. I create PiVoT to gamify this learning process
with the hope of turning an otherwise monotonous experience into something fun and engaging.

### PiVoT's method

PiVoT currently has 3 multiple choice games that users can play. They are all slightly different
and under a timed environment. I believe it is key that there is a time element as this more
accurately reflects the real world and pushes the user to quickly recognize phrasal verbs.

Every time a user chooses a phrasal verb their overall performance and their performance on that
specific phrasal verb is recorded. If the user logs in they can access their scores for the current
day and all the previous days they've had the application. They can also access a table with a full
list of the phrasal verbs and their percentage scores for each one. PiVoT uses this information to
favor the phrasal verbs they are weaker at and so makes the experience unique to each user.
